# Unblocking Rules

If you are the owner of a website or service and it has been blocked by this blocklist, you can open an issue in this repo and I will look into it as soon as possible.

I will NOT remove the rule if your website or service:

- Provides Ads, Tracking, Malware, Crypto Mining, Phishing, etc.
- Has Ads, Tracking, Malware, Crypto Mining, Phishing, etc.

If your website contains pirated content, then:

- IF it is not popular enough or does not have a good enough reputation, it won't be unblocked.
- IF it has Malware, it won't be unblocked.

Reasons that WILL make me unblock your website or service:

- It is a legit service that serves content (CDN)
- Blocking it will break other websites (e.g. CloudFlare)

If you open an issue wanting me to unblock your website or service, then the issue MUST contain:

- The Name, URL and IP of the host
- The EXACT use of that website (What it is for)
- WHY should I unblock it
- What are the potential consequences of blocking it (do websites break?)

If you are NOT the owner of that website or service, you can still request to unblock one.
