# CHANGELOG

## v2.3

Build Time: Scheduled for the Future

In this build, the HaGeZi's Allowlist Referal has been removed. This may mean that email referals and others can stop working. If you need to unbeak them, add the allowlist to your software.

## v2.0

Build Start: 13/8/2024 15:02:27
Built Time: 1:01:56

In this build, most things are the same, except that starting from this build, all URLs are from the original sources whenever possible instead of AdGuard Home, and this has been done to improve liability and possibly more up-to-date blocklists.

## v1.0

Build Start: 8/5/2024 15:40:18

This is the first build, included lists can be found in the config.json. Transformations are: ["Deduplicate", "Compress", "RemoveEmptyLines", "TrimLines", "InsertFinalNewLine"] or can also be checked in the config.json. Most URLs are hosted by the AdGuard Home Team on their GitHub Page.
